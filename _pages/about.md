# Education

## The Firehose Project

### Programming Bootcamp

#### 10/2015 to 4/2016

#### www.firehoseproject.com

Became a capable software developer in this intensive 15-week program, able to break complex problems into more manageable problems. I gained experience with the following tools of the trade:

*   Built basic CRUD Rails apps following standard Rails conventions (without using scaffolding), involving mailers, validations, image uploading on AWS S3, and nested RESTful routes.
*   Implemented tests with Minitest’s Test::Unit syntax for unit and functional tests.
*   Worked through traditional computer science algorithms and data structure challenges:
  *   Graph search (depth-first & breadth-first).
  *   Linked lists with basic Ruby classes.
  *   Stacks and queues in Ruby.
  *   Reversed linked lists (both with a recursive solution with mutation, and a solution that leverages stack-like properties of linked lists).
  *   Floyd’s algorithm (tortoise & hare) to detect cycles within a linked list.
